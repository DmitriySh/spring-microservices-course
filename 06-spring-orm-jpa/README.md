Books library
=======
Use `Spring Boot 2.x` and `Spring ORM`.<br/>
Persistence technology defines objects state (framework) and persists state (database) instead of manually work with the database layer.


## Description
 * The program stores information about books in the Library
 * The program runs in a terminal and use:
   * `H2` in-memory database 
   * tables: book, author and genre
 * Services covered by unit tests


## Documentation
 * [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)-based frameworks require a transaction in order to trigger the synchronization between the objects state (framework) and persist state (database). If you are using an ORM-based framework, you must use transactions
   * Spring-ORM is an umbrella module that covers persistence technologies [JPA](https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/persistence/package-summary.html) and [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/). Spring provides integration classes for each of these technologies so that each technology can be used following Spring principles of configuration and smoothly integrates with Spring transaction management

 * Comprehensive transaction support is among the most compelling reasons to use the Spring Framework. It provides a consistent abstraction for transaction management that delivers the following benefits:
   * declarative transaction management,
   * simpler API than complex transaction APIs such as JTA,
   * consistent programming model across different transaction APIs: JTA, JPA, JDBC
   * solves threadsafe problems to create and bind a Session to the current thread transparently, by exposing a current Session through the Hibernate SessionFactory


 * Java EE developers have had two choices for transaction management: `global` and `local` transactions, both of which have profound limitations
   * global: should work in an application server environment
   * global: cumbersome API to use
   * global: needs to be sourced from JNDI
   * local: cannot work across multiple transactional resources (within a global JTA transaction)
   * local: programmatic transaction management
   * local: database transaction level
 * Spring don't need an application server to manage transactions: you write your code once, and it can benefit from different transaction management strategies in different environments


 * Spring Framework provides programmatic and declarative transaction supports:
   * two type of programmatic transaction management: class [TransactionTemplate](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/TransactionTemplate.html)
   and implementations of interface [PlatformTransactionManager](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/PlatformTransactionManager.html)
   * declarative transaction supports is enabled via AOP proxies and metadata (XML or annotation-based) to create a transactional proxy around the object

 * The interface [PlatformTransactionManager](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/PlatformTransactionManager.html):
   * it can be easily mocked or stubbed as necessary
   * it can be used programmatically (commit/rollback)
   * defined like any other bean in the IoC container
   * use unchecked exceptions ([TransactionException](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/TransactionException.html))
   and don't force to recover the state after transaction failures if a developer doesn't want to catch and handle them
   * only unchecked exceptions marks a transaction for rollback by default and checked exceptions are not
   * is similar to using the JTA UserTransaction API
 * [TransactionTemplate](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/TransactionTemplate.html)
 and [TransactionInterceptor](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/interceptor/TransactionInterceptor.html)
 delegate the actual transaction handling to a `PlatformTransactionManager` instance, which can be a [HibernateTransactionManager](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/hibernate5/HibernateTransactionManager.html)
 (for a single Hibernate SessionFactory, using a ThreadLocal Session under the hood) or a [JtaTransactionManager](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/JtaTransactionManager.html) (delegating to the JTA subsystem of the container)


 * `getTransaction(..)` method returns a [TransactionStatus](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/TransactionStatus.html) object,
 depending on a [TransactionDefinition](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/TransactionDefinition.html)
 parameter specifies transaction rules: Propagation, Isolation, Timeout, Read-only status
 * Springâ€™s highest level template handle resource creation and reuse, cleanup, optional transaction synchronization of the resources,
 exception mapping and can be focused purely on non-boilerplate persistence logic
 * Spring low-level approach is to use classes such as [DataSourceUtils](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/DataSourceUtils.html) (for JDBC),
 [EntityManagerFactoryUtils](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/EntityManagerFactoryUtils.html) (for JPA), 
 [SessionFactoryUtils](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/hibernate5/SessionFactoryUtils.html) (for Hibernate)

 * Mapping JDBC to JPA:
   * `EntityManagerFactory` is a `DataSource`
   * `EntityManager` with `EntityTransaction` is a `Connection`
   * `@Entity` annotates a class represents the table in db
   * `@Column` (is optional) annotates a class field represents the row column in table

 * JPA mapping rules:
   * entity class should have at least one public/protected default constructor
   * not final class, access methods and fields
   * should have Serializable interface if the entity is going to be transferred by the network
   * should have public setter/getter methods and private entity fields

 * Entity states:
   * `New` is a new entity object that didn't connect with any EntityManager yet; use `persist()` to make that connection (like an `upsert` command)
   * `Managed` is an entity object connected with EntityManager already; use `refresh()` to fetch data from db
   * `Removed` is an entity object deleted from EntityManager by `remove()` method; use `persist()` to restore a deleted entity
   * `Detached` is an entity object after: end of transaction, close EntityManager, serialization/deserialization; use `merge()` to sync data with db
   * `Persisted` is a data available only in db and you need to use the method `find()` to fetch and map it to the managed entity object
